    <h2>Introduction to homotopy type theory</h2>
    <h3>Nicolai Kraus, at the EUTYPES summer school, Ohrid 2019</h3>
    <p>Homotopy type theory is a formal system which serves as a programming language as well as a foundation of mathematics. It is a variation of Martin-L&ouml;f type theory, inspired by the observation that &quot;types behave like spaces&quot;. Its novel features are Voevodsky's Univalence Principle (equivalence of types is equality of types) and higher inductive types (constructors for both elements and equalities).</p>

    <p>This course will give a general introduction, demonstrate some of the exciting constructions, and discuss seemingly simple questions that are still open. The main reference will be the <a href="https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/">HoTT book</a>.</p>

    <p>(Further material will be added later.)</p>
