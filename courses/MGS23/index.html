<p>
Category theory studies mathematical structures and relations between them.
It is used in many branches of mathematics and has become a fundamental tool of theoretical computer science.
</p>
<p>
In this course, we will learn the basics of category theory.
No previous knowledge is required.
We will start from the very beginning and discuss plenty of examples in order to get a good understanding of some of the fundamental concepts.
</p>
<p>
There are many good books on category theory. The classic one is
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categories_for_the_Working_Mathematician"><em>Categories for the Working Mathematician</em></a> by Saunders Mac Lane.</li>
</ul>
Some newer and, depending on the reader's background, possibly more accessible introductory books are
<ul>
<li><a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/category-theory-9780199237180?cc=gb&lang=en&"><em>Category Theory</em></a> by Steve Awodey;</li>
<li><a href="https://math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/context.pdf"><em>Category Theory in Context</em></a> by Emily Riehl; and</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09375"><em>Basic Category Theory</em></a> by Tom Leinster.</li>
</ul>
