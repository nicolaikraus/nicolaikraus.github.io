<h2>Homotopy Type Theory</h2>
<h3>Nicolai Kraus, at <a href="https://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/G.Struth/mgs21.html">MGS 2021</a></h3>
    
<p>Homotopy type theory is a formal system in which we can do mathematics. In this course, we will see how this works. In particular, we will learn how a mathematical statement is expressed, what the difference between synthetic (a.k.a. axiomatic) and analytic representation is, what univalence and higher inductive types are, and why truncation levels are important. No prior familiarity of homotopy type theory is assumed, but basic knowledge of both type theory and category theory will be helpful.</p>

<p>More content is to be added soon.</p>
