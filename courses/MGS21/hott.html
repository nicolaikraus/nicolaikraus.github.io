<h2>Homotopy Type Theory</h2>
<h3>Nicolai Kraus, at <a href="https://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/G.Struth/mgs21.html">MGS 2021</a></h3>
    
<p>Homotopy type theory is a formal system in which we can do mathematics. In this course, we will see how this works. In <br>
particular, we will learn how a mathematical statement is expressed, what the difference between synthetic (a.k.a. axiomatic) <br>
and analytic representation is, what univalence and higher inductive types are, and why truncation levels are important. <br>
No prior familiarity of homotopy type theory is assumed, but basic knowledge of both type theory and category <br>
theory will be helpful.</p>

<p>The main reference for this short course is the <a href="https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/">HoTT Book</a>.
</p>

<p>Annotated slides will be added here after the lectures.
