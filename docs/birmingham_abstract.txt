Homotopy Type Theory and Hedberg's Theorem

Intensional Martin-Loef Type Theory, the foundation of systems such as 
Coq and Agda, is currently experiencing a revolution. One of its 
subtleties are equality types: Seemingly among the simplest inductive 
types, are they probably one of the hardest to understand.
In recent years, the justification for a certain axiom, guaranteeing the 
uniqueness of equality proofs, has been questioned. It turned out that, 
after dropping it, type theory has a model in a field that is 
well-researched by mathematicians. At the same time, many desirable 
properties of type theory can be obtained, some of which seemed to be 
impossible before.
In this talk, I provide an introduction to this interesting development, 
usually referred to as "Homotopy Type Theory". Further, I demonstrate 
generalizations of Hedberg's theorem as an example of reasoning in the 
"new" system, based on joint work with Thorsten Altenkirch, Thierry 
Coquand and Martin Escardo.
